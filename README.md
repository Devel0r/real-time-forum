# Introduction

The Real-Time Forum is an advanced web application designed to facilitate dynamic interactions among users through features like post creation, commenting, live messaging, and more, all in real-time. This project builds upon a previous forum model, enhancing its capabilities with real-time data exchange using WebSockets, a single-page application (SPA) architecture, and a blend of technologies including SQLite, Golang, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
